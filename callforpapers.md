<!-- TODO: 
- ADD WHERE THE PAPERS WILL BE PUBLISHED
- ADD SUBMISSION PHASE 2 INFO?
- All deadlines are 11:59 PM, AoE. Please use [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=nesyconf.org/NeSy/2025/Conference_Phase_2) for the late submissions, extended abstracts and industry abstracts. ???
- Are OpenReview links the same but 2026?

We invite you to submit papers to the 20th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2026), which will be held in Lisbon (Portugal) from September 1-4, 2026.

NeSy is the premier annual conference of the research community working on neurosymbolic AI, integrating symbolic and neural approaches to learning, reasoning, and problem-solving in AI. Accepted papers of NeSy 2026 will be published in XXX.
This year, there will be two rounds of submissions. From the first round, there will be the capacity for a “revise and resubmit” decision. For such resubmitted papers, we will attempt to use the same reviewers. 

Please contact [organisers@nesyconf.org](mailto:organisers@nesyconf.org) for any questions about submissions.

## Relevant Dates

Full and Short Paper Submissions (Submission Phase 1)
- Full and short paper abstract deadline: February 24, 2026
- Full and short paper submission: March 3, 2026
- Author notification: April 24, 2026
- Camera-ready: May 24, 2026

All deadlines are 11:59 PM, AoE. 


## Subject Areas 
The NeSy conference invites theoretical, experimental and applied submissions on the integration of neural networks and symbolic AI.
We invite papers on all topics related to Neurosymbolic AI, including but not limited to
- Informed or physics-aware Machine Learning;
- Addressing knowledge representation and reasoning tasks using neural networks;
- Code generation and knowledge engineering with neural networks, including with LLMs;
- Studying and improving LLM reasoning with Neurosymbolic methods;
- Neurosymbolic cognitive modelling;
- Languages for Neurosymbolic AI, including differentiable and probabilistic programming languages;
- Embedding methods for structured information;
- Circuits and knowledge compilation for Neurosymbolic AI;
- Specification and verification of machine/deep learning systems;
- Neurosymbolic AI frameworks: architecture, integration, and composition of different neural or symbolic components
- Neurosymbolic methods for reinforcement, causality, structure, transfer, meta, multitask, continual, or relational learning, and graph neural networks;
- Applications of Neurosymbolic AI, including in education, law, simulation, finance, healthcare, robotics, software engineering, systems engineering, bioinformatics, and visual intelligence.

## Submission guidelines 
- All submissions should be made before the deadline on [our OpenReview page](https://openreview.net/group?id=nesyconf.org/NeSy/2025/Conference_Phase_2). 
- Please use the **Latex template** available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_SmJI3rx548k6KkTPP5QLZoJ8lois26D?usp=sharing). This was updated on 9 May.
- Both full and short paper submissions should be original pieces of work or position papers. They should not have been published elsewhere. We have a strict policy on double submissions. 
- Full and short papers will be in the conference proceedings of NeSy 2025, which will be published with the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/).
- **Full paper** submissions should not exceed **10 pages**, excluding references and supplementary materials. 
- **Short paper and late short paper** submissions should not exceed **5 pages**, excluding references and supplementary materials.
- **Extended abstracts** should provide an overview of relevant papers in neurosymbolic AI and should not exceed **2 pages**. The original papers should be recently published pieces of work at top conferences (e.g, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI etc.) and journals such as (e.g., AIJ, JAIR, MLJ, IEEE TNNLS, NAI etc.). 
- **Industry abstracts** should provide an overview of the industrial effort related to neurosymbolic AI and should not exceed 2 pages. 
- **First round resubmissions in the late deadline** should fill in the text field in the form indicating the changes done from the first round and how they address the reviewers’ comments. These papers will be assigned to the same reviewers as the first round. 

The conference will be held **in-person**, and authors of accepted papers are required to attend the conference physically to present their work. Please note that the late paper and extended abstract notification is rather close to the conference to allow for late-breaking results — authors from outside the US need to make sure that they have enough time to obtain **US visas**. 

**Reviewing** will be double-blind. After notification, reviews of accepted papers will be posted online on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=nesyconf.org/NeSy/2025/Conference_Phase_2) along with the originally submitted version of the paper. Reviewers remain anonymous unless they opt in to them being named. 

Accepted paper authors will be invited to submit **extended versions** of papers to a special issue of the [Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence journal](https://neurosymbolic-ai-journal.com/content/about-neurosymbolic-artificial-intelligence).

All questions about submissions should be addressed to [organisers@nesyconf.org](mailto:organisers@nesyconf.org).
