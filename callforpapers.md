We invite you to submit papers to the 20th International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2026), which will be held in Lisbon (Portugal) from September 1-4, 2026.

NeSy is the premier annual conference of the research community working on neurosymbolic AI, integrating symbolic and neural approaches to learning, reasoning, and problem-solving in AI. Accepted papers of NeSy 2026 will be published in a volume of [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/).
This year, there will be two rounds of submissions. From the first round, there will be the capacity for a “revise and resubmit” decision. For such resubmitted papers, we will attempt to use the same reviewers. 

Please contact [organisers@nesyconf.org](mailto:organisers@nesyconf.org) for any questions about submissions.

## Subject Areas 
The NeSy conference invites theoretical, experimental and applied submissions on the integration of neural networks and symbolic AI.
We invite papers on all topics related to Neurosymbolic AI, including but not limited to
- Informed or physics-aware Machine Learning;
- Addressing knowledge representation and reasoning tasks using neural networks;
- Code generation and knowledge engineering with neural networks, including with LLMs;
- Studying and improving LLM reasoning with Neurosymbolic methods;
- Neurosymbolic cognitive modelling;
- Languages for Neurosymbolic AI, including differentiable and probabilistic programming languages;
- Embedding methods for structured information;
- Circuits and knowledge compilation for Neurosymbolic AI;
- Specification and verification of machine/deep learning systems;
- Neurosymbolic AI frameworks: architecture, integration, and composition of different neural or symbolic components
- Neurosymbolic methods for reinforcement, causality, structure, transfer, meta, multitask, continual, or relational learning, and graph neural networks;
- Applications of Neurosymbolic AI, including in education, law, simulation, finance, healthcare, robotics, software engineering, systems engineering, bioinformatics, and visual intelligence.


## Submission guidelines 
- Please use the **Latex template** available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_SmJI3rx548k6KkTPP5QLZoJ8lois26D). This was updated on December 30th.
- Both full and short paper submissions should be original pieces of work or position papers. They should not have been published elsewhere. We have a strict policy on double submissions.
- Full and short papers will be in the conference proceedings of NeSy 2026, which will be published with the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/).
- **Full paper** submissions should not exceed **10 pages**, excluding references and supplementary materials.
- **Short paper** submissions should not exceed **5 pages**, excluding references and supplementary materials.
- **PhD symposium papers** should provide an overview of the PhD research plan in neurosymbolic AI and should not exceed **4 pages**. 
- **Industry papers** should provide an overview of the industrial effort related to neurosymbolic AI and should not exceed **4 pages**.
- **First round resubmissions in the second phase** should fill in the text field in the form indicating the changes done from the first round and how they address the reviewers’ comments. These papers will be assigned to the same reviewers as the first round. 

The conference will be held in-person, and authors of accepted papers are required to attend the conference physically to present their work.


## Review process
- **Reviewing** will be double-blind. 
- After notification, reviews of accepted papers will be made available on [OpenReview](https:example.com) along with the originally submitted version of the paper. 
  - Reviewers remain anonymous unless they opt in to them being named.
- Reviewers will be provided a “Reject and Resubmit” decision (R&R), which takes the place of “weak reject.” At the editorial discretion of the Chairs, such papers with this predominant decision will be invited to submit to the second round (competing with other papers of the second round).
Authors will be required to submit a changelog and detailed response (similar to a journal article revision cover letter) as part of their supplemental data.
  - Where possible, the same reviewers will be retained for this second round of R&R review.
  - R&R decision does not imply acceptance in the second round.

Accepted paper authors will be invited to submit **extended versions** of papers to a special issue of the [Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence journal](https://neurosymbolic-ai-journal.com/content/about-neurosymbolic-artificial-intelligence).

All questions about submissions should be addressed to [organisers@nesyconf.org](mailto:organisers@nesyconf.org).
